# Feature Design Brief: [TITLE]

## User Story

*from feature request, refined as needed*

```
As a [user concerned by the story]
I want [goal of the story]
So that [reason for the story]
```

## Acceptance Criteria

*from feature request, refined as needed*

## Design Diagram(s)

*at least includes a diagram created by us (not vendor ref. architectures) that shows the intended design within our solution.  Solution elements should be numbered and details expanded upon in the Design Explanation section below as needed for clarity.  This is design is meant to be refined more than a conceptual diagram, but does not need to be to the level of a detailed design or as-built*

## Design Explanation

## Security Design / Security Considerations

## Operational Considerations

## Architecture Decisions Made

|Num|Description|Name|
|---|---|---|
| 001 | *We will embrace cloud native solution X for ease of implementation and integration with config-as-code solution* | Dev Lead|

## Decisions Required

- *list of decisions that need to be made still, who is expected to make them, and an impact statement*

## Proposed Work Plan

*list of PBI/tasks in a bullet list estimated as needed to implement design with estimates*

### Refined Estimate

*one of*

```
2 days (around 8 development hours)
3 days (around 12 development hours)
5 days (around 20 development hours)
10 days (around 40 development hours)
20 days (around 80 development hours)
other...(explain)
```

## List of Impacted Elements

### Packages (existing or new)

### Design Documents

### User Documentation

### Operational and Security Documentation

## Next Steps

*one of*
